# Puzzle 4: 2D Map

{{ youtube EjmBmwgdAT0 breakpoint-lg }}

## Overview

Implement a kernel that adds 10 to each position of 2D square matrix `a` and
stores it in 2D square matrix `output`.

**Note:** _You have more threads than positions_.

## Key concepts

- 2D thread indexing
- Matrix operations on GPU
- Handling excess threads
- Memory layout patterns

For each position \\((i,j)\\):
\\[\Large output[i,j] = a[i,j] + 10\\]

> ## Thread indexing convention
>
> When working with 2D matrices in GPU programming, we follow a natural mapping
> between thread indices and matrix coordinates:
>
> - `thread_idx.y` corresponds to the row index
> - `thread_idx.x` corresponds to the column index

>
> This convention aligns with:
>
> 1. The standard mathematical notation where matrix positions are specified as (row, column)
> 2. The visual representation of matrices where rows go top-to-bottom (y-axis) and columns go left-to-right (x-axis)
> 3. Common GPU programming patterns where thread blocks are organized in a 2D grid matching the matrix structure
>
> ### Historical origins
>
> While graphics and image processing typically use \\((x,y)\\) coordinates,
> matrix operations in computing have historically used (row, column) indexing.
> This comes from how early computers stored and processed 2D data: line by
> line, top to bottom, with each line read left to right. This row-major memory
> layout proved efficient for both CPUs and GPUs, as it matches how they access
> memory sequentially. When GPU programming adopted thread blocks for parallel
> processing, it was natural to map `thread_idx.y` to rows and `thread_idx.x` to
> columns, maintaining consistency with established matrix indexing conventions.

## Implementation approaches

### [🔰 Raw memory approach](./raw.md)

Learn how 2D indexing works with manual memory management.

### [📚 Learn about TileTensor](./introduction_tile_tensor.md)

Discover a powerful abstraction that simplifies multi-dimensional array
operations and memory management on GPU.

### [🚀 Modern 2D operations](./tile_tensor.md)

Put TileTensor into practice with natural 2D indexing and explicit bounds
checking.

💡 **Note**: From this puzzle onward, we'll primarily use TileTensor for
cleaner, safer GPU code.
