# 🧐 Detective Work: First Case

## Overview

This puzzle presents a crashing GPU program where your task is to identify the
issue using only `(cuda-gdb)` debugging tools, without examining the source
code. Apply your debugging skills to solve the mystery!

**Prerequisites**: Complete [Mojo GPU Debugging Essentials](./essentials.md) to
understand CUDA-GDB setup and basic debugging commands. Make sure you've run:

```bash
pixi run -e nvidia setup-cuda-gdb
```

This auto-detects your CUDA installation and sets up the necessary links for GPU
debugging.

## Key concepts

In this debugging challenge, you'll learn about:

- **Systematic debugging**: Using error messages as clues to find root causes
- **Error analysis**: Reading crash messages and stack traces
- **Hypothesis formation**: Making educated guesses about the problem
- **Debugging workflow**: Step-by-step investigation process

## Running the code

First, examine the kernel without looking at the complete code:

```mojo
{{#include ../../../problems/p09/p09.mojo:first_crash}}
```

To experience the bug firsthand, run the following command in your terminal
(`pixi` only):

```bash
pixi run -e nvidia p09 --first-case
```

You'll see output like this when the program crashes:

```txt
First Case: Try to identify what's wrong without looking at the code!

stack trace was not collected. Enable stack trace collection with environment variable `MOJO_ENABLE_STACK_TRACE_ON_ERROR`
Unhandled exception caught during execution: At open-source/max/Mojo/stdlib/stdlib/gpu/host/device_context.mojo:2082:17: CUDA call failed: CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_IMAGE (device kernel image is invalid)
To get more accurate error information, set MODULAR_DEBUG=device-sync-mode.
/home/ubuntu/workspace/mojo-gpu-puzzles/.pixi/envs/nvidia/bin/mojo: error: execution exited with a non-zero result: 1
```

## Your task: detective work

**Challenge**: Without looking at the code yet, what would be your debugging
strategy to investigate this crash?

Start with:

```bash
pixi run -e nvidia mojo debug --cuda-gdb --break-on-launch problems/p09/p09.mojo --first-case
```

<summary><strong>Tips</strong></summary>

<div class="solution-tips">

1. **Read the crash message carefully** - `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` means the
   GPU tried to access invalid memory
2. **Check the breakpoint information** - Look at the function parameters shown
   when CUDA-GDB stops
3. **Inspect all pointers systematically** - Use `print` to examine each pointer
   parameter
4. **Look for suspicious addresses** - Valid GPU addresses are typically large
   hex numbers (what does `0x0` mean?)
5. **Test memory access** - Try accessing the data through each pointer to see
   which one fails
6. **Apply the systematic approach** - Like a detective, follow the evidence
   from symptom to root cause
7. **Compare valid vs invalid patterns** - If one pointer works and another
   doesn't, focus on the broken one

## Step-by-step investigation with CUDA-GDB

### Launch the debugger

```bash
pixi run -e nvidia mojo debug --cuda-gdb --break-on-launch problems/p09/p09.mojo --first-case
```

### Examine the breakpoint information

When CUDA-GDB stops, it immediately shows valuable clues:

```text
(cuda-gdb) run
CUDA thread hit breakpoint, p09_add_10_... (output=0x302000000, a=0x0)
    at /home/ubuntu/workspace/mojo-gpu-puzzles/problems/p09/p09.mojo:37
37          var i = thread_idx.x
```

**🔍 First Clue**: The function signature shows `(output=0x302000000, a=0x0)`

- `output` has a valid GPU memory address
- `a` is `0x0` - this is a null pointer!

### Systematic variable inspection

```text
(cuda-gdb) next
38          output[unsafe_offset=i] = a[unsafe_offset=i] + 10.0
(cuda-gdb) print i
$1 = 0
(cuda-gdb) print output
$2 = (!kgen.scalar<f32> * @register) 0x302000000
(cuda-gdb) print a
$3 = (!kgen.scalar<f32> * @register) 0x0
```

**Evidence Gathering**:

- ✅ Thread index `i=0` is valid
- ✅ Result pointer `0x302000000` is a proper GPU address
- ❌ Input pointer `0x0` is null

### Confirm the problem

```text
(cuda-gdb) print a[i]
Cannot access memory at address 0x0
```

**Smoking Gun**: Cannot access memory at null address - this confirms the crash
cause!

## Root cause analysis

**The Problem**: Now if we look at the [code](../../../problems/p09/p09.mojo)
for `--first-case`, we see that the host code creates a null pointer instead of
allocating proper GPU memory:

```mojo
# A `DeviceBuffer` with 0 elements. Nothing is allocated, so the buffer hands
# the kernel a NULL pointer.
var input_buf = ctx.enqueue_create_buffer[dtype](0)
```

**Why This Crashes**:

1. `ctx.enqueue_create_buffer[dtype](0)` creates a `DeviceBuffer` with zero (0)
   elements.
2. Since there are no elements for which to allocate memory, this returns a
   null pointer.
3. This null pointer gets passed to the GPU kernel.
4. When the kernel evaluates `a[unsafe_offset=i]`, it dereferences null →
   `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS`.

## The fix

Replace null pointer creation with proper buffer allocation:

```mojo
# Wrong: creates a null pointer
var input_buf = ctx.enqueue_create_buffer[dtype](0)

# Correct: allocate and initialize actual GPU memory for safe processing
var input_buf = ctx.enqueue_create_buffer[dtype](SIZE)
input_buf.enqueue_fill(0)
```

## Key debugging lessons

**Pattern Recognition**:

- `0x0` addresses are always null pointers
- Valid GPU addresses are large hex numbers (e.g., `0x302000000`)

**Debugging Strategy**:

1. **Read crash messages** - They often hint at the problem type
2. **Check function parameters** - CUDA-GDB shows them at breakpoint entry
3. **Inspect all pointers** - Compare addresses to identify null/invalid ones
4. **Test memory access** - Try dereferencing suspicious pointers
5. **Trace back to allocation** - Find where the problematic pointer was created

**💡 Key Insight**: This type of null pointer bug is extremely common in GPU
programming. The systematic CUDA-GDB investigation approach you learned here
applies to debugging many other GPU memory issues, race conditions, and kernel
crashes.

## Next steps: from crashes to silent bugs

**You've learned crash debugging!** You can now:

- **Systematically investigate GPU crashes** using error messages as clues
- **Identify null pointer bugs** through pointer address inspection
- **Use CUDA-GDB effectively** for memory-related debugging

### Your next challenge: [Detective Work: Second Case](./second_case.md)

**But what if your program doesn't crash?** What if it runs perfectly but
produces **wrong results**?

The [Second Case](./second_case.md) presents a completely different debugging
challenge:

- **No crash messages** to guide you
- **No obvious pointer problems** to investigate
- **No stack traces** pointing to the issue
- **Just wrong results** that need systematic investigation

**New skills you'll develop:**

- **Logic bug detection** - Finding algorithmic errors without crashes
- **Pattern analysis** - Using incorrect output to trace back to root causes
- **Execution flow debugging** - When variable inspection fails due to
  optimizations

The systematic investigation approach you learned here - reading clues, forming
hypotheses, testing systematically - forms the foundation for debugging the more
subtle logic errors ahead.
