# Puzzle 7: 2D Blocks

## Overview

Implement a kernel that adds 10 to each position of 2D TileTensor `a` and stores
it in 2D TileTensor `output`.

**Note:**
_You have fewer threads per block than the size of `a` in both directions._

## Key concepts

In this puzzle, you'll learn about:

- Using `TileTensor` with multiple blocks
- Handling large matrices with 2D block organization
- Combining block indexing with `TileTensor` access

The key insight is that `TileTensor` simplifies 2D indexing while still
requiring proper block coordination for large matrices.

## Configuration

- **Matrix size**: \\(5 \times 5\\) elements
- **Layout handling**: `TileTensor` manages row-major organization
- **Block coordination**: Multiple blocks cover the full matrix
- **2D indexing**: Natural \\((i,j)\\) access with bounds checking
- **Total threads**: \\(36\\) for \\(25\\) elements
- **Thread mapping**: Each thread processes one matrix element

<div class="solution-tips">

1. Calculate global indices: `row = block_dim.y * block_idx.y + thread_idx.y`,
   `col = block_dim.x * block_idx.x + thread_idx.x`
2. Add guard: `if row < size and col < size`
3. Inside guard: think about how to add 10 to 2D TileTensor

## Running the code

To test your solution, run the following command in your terminal:

<div class="code-tabs" data-tab-group="package-manager">
  <div class="tab-buttons">
    <button class="tab-button">pixi NVIDIA (default)</button>
    <button class="tab-button">pixi AMD</button>
    <button class="tab-button">pixi Apple</button>
    <button class="tab-button">uv</button>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
pixi run p07
```

  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
pixi run -e amd p07
```

  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
pixi run -e apple p07
```

  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
uv run poe p07
```

  </div>
</div>

If the puzzle isn't solved yet, `out` prints as an all-zero \\(5 \times 5\\)
grid while `expected` holds `10.0` through `34.0`. Both are wrapped in a
`TileTensor` before printing, so they render as a two-dimensional grid rather
than as a flat buffer.

This solution demonstrates how TileTensor simplifies 2D block-based processing:

1. **2D thread indexing**
   - Global row: `block_dim.y * block_idx.y + thread_idx.y`
   - Global col: `block_dim.x * block_idx.x + thread_idx.x`
   - Maps thread grid to tensor elements:

     ```txt
     5×5 tensor with 3×3 blocks:

     Block (0,0)         Block (1,0)
     [(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)] [(0,3) (0,4)    *  ]
     [(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)] [(1,3) (1,4)    *  ]
     [(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)] [(2,3) (2,4)    *  ]

     Block (0,1)         Block (1,1)
     [(3,0) (3,1) (3,2)] [(3,3) (3,4)    *  ]
     [(4,0) (4,1) (4,2)] [(4,3) (4,4)    *  ]
     [  *     *     *  ] [  *     *      *  ]
     ```

     (* = thread exists but outside tensor bounds)

2. **TileTensor benefits**
   - Natural 2D indexing: `tensor[row, col]` instead of manual offset
     calculation
   - The row-major layout travels with the tensor, so the offset arithmetic
     stays out of the kernel
   - Example access pattern:

     ```txt
     Raw memory:         TileTensor:
     row * size + col    tensor[row, col]
     (2,1) -> 11        (2,1) -> same element
     ```

3. **Bounds checking**
   - The grid launches 36 threads (2×2 blocks of 3×3) for 25 elements
   - Guard `row < size and col < size` switches off the 11 threads that land
     outside the tensor
   - Without the guard, those threads would read and write past the end of the
     buffer—the exact bug [puzzle 10](../puzzle_10/memcheck.md) hunts down

4. **Block coordination**
   - Each 3×3 block covers one tile of the 5×5 tensor
   - The block indices decide which tile a block touches; the guard decides
     which of its threads do any work
   - `TileTensor` maps `(row, col)` to a flat offset the same way from every
     block, so no block needs to know where its tile starts

This pattern shows how TileTensor simplifies 2D block processing while keeping
thread coordination explicit.
