# Puzzle 32: Bank Conflicts

## Why this puzzle matters

**Completing the performance trilogy:** You've learned GPU profiling tools in
[Puzzle 30](../puzzle_30/puzzle_30.md) and understood occupancy optimization in
[Puzzle 31](../puzzle_31/puzzle_31.md). Now you're ready for the final piece of
the performance optimization puzzle: **shared memory efficiency**.

**The hidden performance trap:** You can write GPU kernels with perfect
occupancy, optimal global memory coalescing, and identical mathematical
operations - yet still experience dramatic performance differences due to
**how threads access shared memory**. Bank conflicts represent one of the most
subtle but impactful performance pitfalls in GPU programming.

**The learning journey:**

- **Puzzle 30** taught you to **measure and diagnose** performance with Nsight
  profiling
- **Puzzle 31** taught you to **predict and control** resource usage through
  occupancy analysis
- **Puzzle 32** teaches you to **optimize shared memory access patterns** for
  maximum efficiency

**Why this matters beyond GPU programming:** The principles of memory banking,
conflict detection, and systematic access pattern optimization apply across many
parallel computing systems - from CPU cache hierarchies to distributed memory
architectures.

> **Note: This puzzle is specific to NVIDIA GPUs**
>
> Bank conflict analysis uses NVIDIA's 32-bank shared memory architecture and
> Nsight Compute profiling tools. While the optimization principles apply
> broadly, the specific techniques and measurements are NVIDIA CUDA-focused.

## Overview

**Shared memory bank conflicts** occur when multiple threads in a warp
simultaneously access different addresses within the same memory bank, forcing
the hardware to serialize these accesses. This can transform what should be a
single-cycle memory operation into multiple cycles of serialized access.

**What you'll discover:**

- How GPU shared memory banking works at the hardware level
- Why identical kernels can have vastly different shared memory efficiency
- How to predict and measure bank conflicts before they impact performance
- Professional optimization strategies for designing conflict-free algorithms

**The detective methodology:** This puzzle follows the same evidence-based
approach as previous performance puzzles - you'll use profiling tools to uncover
hidden inefficiencies, then apply systematic optimization principles to
eliminate them.

## Key concepts

**Shared memory architecture fundamentals:**

- **32-bank design**: NVIDIA GPUs organize shared memory into 32 independent
  banks
- **Conflict types**: No conflict (optimal), N-way conflicts (serialized),
  broadcast (optimized)
- **Access pattern mathematics**: Bank assignment formulas and conflict
  prediction
- **Performance impact**: From optimal 1-cycle access to worst-case 32-cycle
  serialization

**Professional optimization skills:**

- **Pattern analysis**: Mathematical prediction of banking behavior
- **Profiling methodology**: Nsight Compute metrics for conflict measurement
- **Design principles**: Conflict-free algorithm patterns and prevention
  strategies
- **Performance validation**: Evidence-based optimization using systematic
  measurement

### **[📚 Understanding Shared Memory Banks](./shared_memory_bank.md)**

Learn the theoretical foundations of GPU shared memory banking through clear
explanations and practical examples.

**You'll learn:**

- How NVIDIA's 32-bank architecture enables parallel access
- The mathematics of bank assignment and conflict prediction
- Types of conflicts and their performance implications
- Connection to previous concepts (warp execution, occupancy, profiling)

**Key insight:** Understanding the hardware enables you to predict performance
before writing code.

### **[Conflict-Free Patterns](./conflict_free_patterns.md)**

Apply your banking knowledge to solve a performance mystery using professional
profiling techniques.

**The detective challenge:** Two kernels compute identical results but have
dramatically different shared memory access efficiency. Use Nsight Compute to
uncover why one kernel experiences systematic bank conflicts while the other
achieves optimal performance.

**Skills developed:** Pattern analysis, conflict measurement, systematic
optimization, and evidence-based performance improvement.
